# TODO 

1. Add aggregation.py with various aggregation strategies

2. Add SSL to Socket

3. Add password for each client

# Considerations

1. YAML or .py config?

2. Who decides the augmentations to be used? 

3. Should the server send some variables like model name or the whole config file itself and ask the client to manually define certain paths? 

4. Front End
